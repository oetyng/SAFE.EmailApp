## Features
- First step would be to Authorize the SAFE email app by authenticating it using the [SAFE Authenticator mobile](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-authenticator-mobile). 
- Create a Public ID which would act as a unique identifier on the SAFE email app. Option to create multiple Public ID's that could be used to create different communication channels. For instance different accounts for personal & official use.
- Compose an email and send it to another user by addressing it to their Public ID.
- Receive & reply to an email from another user.
